"""Test-only Python-native NEML2 models.

These are test-only Python-native models backing regression-test inputs:
``TabulatedPolynomialModel`` and ``SurrogateFlowRate`` (the latter a
machine-learning-surrogate flow rate demonstrating ``request_AD``, replacing the
v2-era ``TorchScriptFlowRate``). They live here rather than in ``neml2.models``
because they only exist for the tests — they have no place in the production
native package.

Importing this package side-effect-registers every fixture with the native
factory registry via ``@register_neml2_object``. The native ``regression/conftest.py``
imports it so the registrations fire before pytest collects the input files.
