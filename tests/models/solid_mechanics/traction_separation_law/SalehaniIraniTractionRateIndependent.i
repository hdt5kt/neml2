# neml2
# The rate-independent branch of SalehaniIraniTraction (viscosity = 0), on the
# same loading as SalehaniIraniTraction.i -- where d_trial = 0.5276334473 already
# sits below damage~1 = 0.6, so the irreversibility cap freezes and d must come
# back as exactly 0.6. Raising damage~1 above d_trial is the whole point: on the
# advancing branch d is independent of d_old, so only a regressing trial makes
# `damage~1` load-bearing in the *value*.
# This is also the backward-compatibility guarantee -- eta = 0 has to reproduce
# the pre-viscosity law exactly.
