# neml2
# The rate-independent branch of BilinearTraction (viscosity = 0), on a
# *regressing* trial damage: d_trial = 0.5555555556 sits below damage~1 = 0.6, so
# the irreversibility cap freezes and d must come back as exactly 0.6.
# This is the backward-compatibility guarantee -- eta = 0 has to reproduce the
# pre-viscosity law bit for bit -- and it is the scenario that makes
# `damage~1` load-bearing in the *value*, which the blended scenario cannot do
# (on the advancing branch d is independent of d_old at all).
# Loading is otherwise identical to BilinearTraction.i, so the two files differ
# only in the branch under test: here
#   T_n  = 1000 (1 - 0.6) 0.02 = 8.0
#   T_s1 = 1000 (1 - 0.6) 0.01 = 4.0
