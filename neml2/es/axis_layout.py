"""Variable-group layout for the equation-system blocks.

:class:`AxisLayout` ties a tuple of variable groups to their tensor
types and per-variable sub-batch shapes. :class:`~AssembledVector` and
:class:`~AssembledMatrix` carry one of these to know how to disassemble
their flat per-group tensors back into named variables.

Per-group ``SubBatchStructure`` (v2-parity, mirrors v2's ``IStructure``)
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Each variable group declares ``structure: SubBatchStructure`` -- either
``"block"`` or ``"dense"``:

* ``"block"`` -- the group's sub_batch axes are PRESERVED as
  intermediate dims on the per-group assembled tensor. Storage shape
  is ``(*dyn, *sub_batch, group_storage_size)`` for a vector or
  ``(*dyn, *intmd_row, *intmd_col, row_storage, col_storage)`` for a
  matrix block. Used when sub_batch axes carry per-site independence
  the solver should preserve (per-grain in polycrystal, per-cell in
  finite-volume, per-bin in KWN). The implicit block matmul reduces
  via ``inner / sum_sub_batch`` along the intmd axes for an inner
  group whose ``structure == "block"``.
* ``"dense"`` -- the group's sub_batch axes are FOLDED into the base
  storage. Shape is ``(*dyn, group_storage_size_with_sub_folded)``
  for a vector. Used for groups whose sub_batch axes don't represent
  per-site independence (typically global unknowns / forces).

The user specifies ``structure`` in the HIT ``[EquationSystems]`` block
(``structure = 'block dense'`` -- space-separated, one token per group, in
group order). Defaults to all ``"dense"`` when omitted.
