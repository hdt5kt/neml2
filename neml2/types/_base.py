"""Common base for the typed tensor wrapper classes.

`TensorWrapper` carries the shared shape decomposition + region views +
``_rewrap`` machinery. Each concrete wrapper is a
``@dataclass(frozen=True, eq=False)`` with these fields:

- ``data: torch.Tensor`` -- the underlying storage.
- ``sub_batch_ndim: int`` -- count of trailing batch axes that act
  as a structured "sub-batch" region (the Python-native analogue of the
  C++ ``intmd_dim``).
- ``sub_batch_state: tuple[SubBatchStateFlag, ...]`` -- per-axis
  ``"full"`` / ``"broadcast"`` storage mode (see :mod:`neml2.chain_rule`).
- ``sub_batch_meta: tuple[int, ...]`` -- per-axis logical extent
  consulted only when the axis is in broadcast mode.
- ``k_ndim: int`` -- count of leading K (seed-direction) axes
  carried by a chain-rule tangent. Primal wrappers have ``k_ndim == 0``.
- ``k_state: tuple[KStateFlag, ...]`` -- per-K-axis ``"full"`` /
  ``"broadcast"`` storage mode. Length must equal ``k_ndim``.
- ``k_pairing: tuple[int | None, ...]`` -- per-K-axis pairing.
  ``k_pairing[i] = j`` means K axis i is paired with sub_batch axis j;
  the seed for that pair is the eye-shape diagonal on (K_i, sub_j).
  ``None`` means the K axis is a base-direction enumerator with no
  sub pairing. Length must equal ``k_ndim``.

Every field but ``data`` defaults to :data:`UNSET` rather than to its
no-region value, so that "said nothing" and "said there is no region" are
distinguishable. :func:`seat_metadata` resolves them before
``__post_init__`` returns -- inheriting from the inner wrapper on a re-wrap,
falling back to the no-region value otherwise -- so no wrapper is ever
observable holding :data:`UNSET`.

Shape decomposition
-------------------

A wrapper's tensor shape splits into FOUR regions::

    data.shape == (*K, *dynamic_batch_shape, *sub_batch_shape, *base_shape)
                  └─ K ─┘└── leading ──┘└── middle (static) ──┘└─ BASE_NDIM ─┘

- ``base_shape`` is fixed by the wrapper type (e.g. ``(6,)`` for SR2).
- ``sub_batch_shape`` is the next ``sub_batch_ndim`` trailing batch axes.
  These broadcast like batch dims in forward ops but encode per-site
  structure (cells, slip systems, grains) that the chain-rule machinery
  treats specially.
- ``dynamic_batch_shape`` is everything between K and sub_batch (the
  variable dim count that ``torch.export`` traces as dynamic).
- ``K`` is the ``k_ndim`` leading axes carried by a chain-rule tangent.
  Primal values have ``k_ndim == 0`` and so this region is absent.

The combined ``batch_shape`` (``dynamic + sub_batch``) matches the C++
``batch_dim() = dynamic_dim + intmd_dim`` invariant. The K region sits
ENTIRELY LEFT OF ``batch_shape`` -- region-view computations use
``data.ndim - BASE_NDIM - sub_batch_ndim`` for the right edge of dyn
and subtract ``k_ndim`` from the left to find dyn's left edge.

Region-view API
---------------

Shape-manipulating ops are exposed through region-view properties --
``t.batch``, ``t.dynamic_batch``, ``t.sub_batch``, ``t.base`` -- and a
``t.k`` view over the K region. Each view is computed on access (no
storage, no pytree registration) and its methods return a fresh wrapper,
so chaining works.

The K region is read-mostly today; tangent-side reshapes are driven by
the chain-rule primitives in :mod:`neml2.types.functions` (``fullify``,
``sum_sub_batch``, exposing reductions), not by direct K-view mutation.
