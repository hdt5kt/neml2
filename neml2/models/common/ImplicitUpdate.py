    shape.

    A value that already carries a sub-batch region is left alone, but must

    An unmarked value is only expanded when it has no batch axes at all. With

    members" from "twelve sites", and expanding regardless turns a value that
    already meant sites into ``(12, 12)`` without a word. Guessing is worse

    forward
        Run Newton to convergence in ``no_grad`` mode (so no graph builds up
        through the iterations) and return the converged unknowns as a tuple
        in ``system.unknown_names`` order.

    backward
        At converged ``u*`` we have $r(u*, g, p) = 0$ so by the IFT
        $du*/dθ = -A^{-1} · dr/dθ$ for any parameter ``θ`` (input or model
        parameter). The adjoint vector $λ = A^{-T} · grad_u*$ is computed by
        a single linear solve, then ``torch.autograd.grad(r, [inputs, params],
        -λ)`` extracts the corresponding gradient contributions in one pass.
        No per-leaf parameter chain-rule actions are needed — autograd discovers
        ``dr/dθ`` for free.

    Notes
    -----
    * Only ``inputs`` are passed through ``ctx.save_for_backward`` — that's
      what autograd's version-tracking machinery is designed for. ``u_star``
      is stored as a plain ctx attribute (it's a Function output, not a
      tracked input). ``params`` are accessed live from
      ``owner.parameters()`` in backward — saved-tensor copies are returned
      detached, which would break the autograd path back to the live
      ``nn.Parameter`` objects that ``model.forward`` actually reads from.
    * The Function's positional signature is
      ``(owner, n_inputs, input_sbn, *inputs_and_params)``; only the
      ``*inputs_and_params`` tail participates in PyTorch's grad routing (the
      leading three are non-tensors). The returned grad tuple must therefore
      start with ``(None, None, None, ...)``.
