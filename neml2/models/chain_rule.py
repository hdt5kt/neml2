"""Shared type aliases for chain-rule sensitivity propagation.

Tangents in transit through the framework are ordinary typed wrappers
(``Scalar`` / ``SR2`` / ``R2`` / ...) carrying one or more leading K
(seed-direction) axes -- a tangent of type ``T`` *is* a ``T``, with
``k_ndim > 0`` and ``k_state`` / ``k_pairing`` recording the per-K-axis
storage layout (see :class:`neml2.types._base.TensorWrapper`).

Per the v2-parity refactor, the declarative ``EdgeInfo`` / ``list_deriv``
machinery has been removed. The chain rule no longer dispatches on
labels -- it relies on positional ``k_pairing`` metadata to know when a
K axis is paired with a sub_batch axis (cheap broadcast diagonal) vs
when it has been exposed to per-site enumeration.

When a leaf's action would contract a paired sub_batch axis (e.g. a
``sum`` / ``mean`` / ``inner`` that mixes per-site data), it must call
``fullify`` from :mod:`neml2.types.functions` first. The exposing
reductions (``sum_sub_batch``, ``sum`` / ``mean`` over a K-paired axis)
handle the common case automatically.

    """Tile compact-K contributions to match the max-K contribution.

    Apply-chain-rule accumulates contributions for the same seed leaf across
    multiple input edges. Different edges can produce different K storage
    widths -- one edge may carry a tangent whose K axes have been exposed
    (full) by a reducing op, while a parallel edge with no sub_batch
    interaction carries an un-exposed (broadcast) tangent with the same
    K_ndim but smaller storage.

    Summing tensors of different storage K widths along the leading K axes is
    shape-incompatible. The fix is to tile the lower-K contributions to the
    common max along each K axis. A compact contribution represents a response
    that does not depend on the per-site index (definitionally -- it came from
    a chain with no sub_batch interaction), so tiling preserves semantics.

    Returns a list of contributions all with the same leading K storage shape.
