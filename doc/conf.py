# Execute the cheap tutorial notebooks at build time and cache the results
# (cache lives under `_build/.jupyter_cache/`), so editing prose around a
# stable code cell does not re-execute it. The executable notebooks live
# under `content/tutorials/` and `content/modules/`, so a global `cache`
# only ever runs those; the syntax-catalog and reference pages have no
# executable cells and cost nothing.
#
# `nb_execution_in_temp` runs each notebook in a throwaway directory: the
# Colab-runnable tutorials create their own input files via `%%writefile`,
# so executing in a temp dir keeps those writes (and any `neml2-compile`
# artifacts) out of the source tree while relative `load_model("input.i")`
# still resolves against the same cwd.
#
# The expensive notebooks below are excluded from execution and instead
# render from their committed, pre-baked outputs (kept executed by the
# scoped `check-notebook-executed` pre-commit hook); executing them needs a
# GPU and minutes-to-hours per run. These are the two pyzag calibration
# tutorials plus the physics-module KWN worked examples (316H precipitation,
# Al-Cu TTP) re-homed from v2's `python/examples/`. Patterns are matched
# against the path tail (`PurePosixPath.match`).
